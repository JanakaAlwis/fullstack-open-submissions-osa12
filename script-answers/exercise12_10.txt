# Exercise 12.10

Used Docker volumes to mount local source code into the container.

Modified `index.js` on the host and saw changes in the container without rebuilding the image.

Dockerfile installs dependencies, while docker-compose mounts the source code:

docker-compose.yml:
  volumes:
    - .:/usr/src/app

Command used:
docker compose up --build

Result:
Changes in host code reflected in container after restart.
